    <h1>Making Disciples</h1>
      <p><em>When we are a mature disciple, we need to learn how to make new disciples. This will include witnessing as well as helping a new disciple to grow. </em></p>

    <p>
      I also like to list down three basic things.
    <p>
      <h4>It is a Command</h4>
      Firstly, it is a command and a necessary one. We are told to go and make disciples of all nations. Therefore, we need to be eager to look out for opportunities. Many current issues of life such as death, work and marriage are natural springboard to a spiritual conversation.
    <p>
      <h4>It is about Jesus</h4>
      Secondly, the gospel needs to be presented. We are a witness for our Lord Jesus Christ and His completed works on the cross. We may not need to present it at one go. But we should present it progressively to the point where we allow a person to consider if he or she could decide to receive Jesus as Saviour and Lord. The presentation in the witnessing could be used as a simple one.
    <p>
      <h4>Trust God</h4>
      Thirdly, remember God is with us always. When we shared the good news, we are relying on Him to do the conviction of heart so the listener can believe. There is no need for pressure tactics and guilt trip. It is a relationship with God and He will work it out for good. We are there to facilitate and partner with God so He could complete His plan and we can share His joy.
