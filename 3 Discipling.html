    <h1>Discipling</h1>
      <p><em>A disciple is a follower of Jesus Christ. Discipling is therefore, helping another person to follow Jesus and witnessing is really, the first step of making disciple. </em></p>

      There are many things to learn as a new believer. I have listed three basic things.
    <p>
      <h4>Baptism</h4>
      The first thing is to be baptized. Baptism literary means being immersed in water. It is a ceremony which signifies a person leaving the world and following Jesus. It is an act in which a new believer declares openly that he or she is a follower of Christ. It is an important ceremony as it reflects a person’s faith in his or her heart determining to follow Jesus.  As Jesus Himself said in Mark 8:38 ESV: “For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.” I encourage you to sign up for baptism class in a Church to learn more and how to go about it.
    <p>
      <h4>Prayer</h4>
     The second thing is how to talk to God. This is prayer in essence. We called God, our Father in Heaven. This is to acknowledge who He is. He is God and lives in Heaven. He created our lives and redeemed us to be His children. Therefore, He is truly, our Father in Heaven. We can talk to Him on anything, praising Him for who He is, thanking Him for providing our needs and asking Him to help us in our difficulties. We can also pray for another person such as our relative, friend, neighbour, and even someone we do not know. Nothing will be too difficult for God to answer our prayers. We then close our prayers in Jesus Name, Amen. By praying in Jesus Name, we acknowledge that our right to pray to God is not based on our own merits. Instead, it is based on what Jesus did on the Cross, forgiving our sins and clothing us with His righteousness so we can stand before God and pray. I recommend that you use Luke 11:1-4 when Jesus taught the disciples and start learning how to pray.
    <p>
      <h4>Bible Reading</h4>
     The third thing is how to read the Bible. The Bible recorded the words spoken by God to His people through many generations. God often use the Bible to speak to us, guide us and encourage us. “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work (2 Timothy 3:16-17 ESV). There are many ways to read the Bible. You can use a Bible reading plan to help you read a portion each day. Many good plans can be downloaded from the web. You can also read from the start to the end like a story book. The key is to read regularly and allow the words to speak to us.
