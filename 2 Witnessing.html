    <h3>The Presentation</h3>
    <p>
      <h4>Where do Human Beings come from?</h4>
The Bible says that in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. (Genesis 1:1 NIV). God also made the first man and woman and from them came all the generations of humans. The first man and woman lived with God in close fellowship.
      <h4>How does sins enter the world?</h4>
But one day, they were tempted by the devil and decided to disobey God. As a result of the sin, the relationship with God was broken and they were separated from God. Sin and death entered the human world from that point onwards. All future human offspring inherited the sinful nature and face physical death after our lives finish on earth. We also face eternal separation from God.
      <h4>What did God do to save us?</h4>
God continue to love us despite our sins. At the appointed time, He gave His Son Jesus Christ who become a man during the first Christmas two thousand years ago. He died on the cross to pay for the penalty of our sins. He was resurrected three days later and returned to the Heaven. He has given us the gift of eternal life. Whoever receive this gift will have eternal life.
The Bible puts it this way: For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life (John 3:16 NIV).
      <h4>How do I receive the gift of eternal life?</h4>
The Bible says that if you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved (Romans 10:9).
Therefore, if you wish to receive this gift, say this prayer to God:
<p/>Dear God, thank You that You love me so much and gave me Your Son, Jesus Christ to die for me on the cross. I now believe that You have raised Him from the dead. I declare that Jesus is my Lord and I am saved according to Your promise. Thank You Lord for the eternal life You have given me and I have now received. Amen.<pr/>
